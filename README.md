# ffmpeg-with-libfdk-aac


I spent too many hours trying to successfully build a non-linked version of ffmpeg which supports libfdk_aac as it is not legal to distribute, so I built this github action to build it for me.

Clone this repo to your own gh account, then run the action via the Actions tab on your repo. At the end there will be an artifact available for 24 hours that you have built yourself for personal use.
